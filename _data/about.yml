- title: "Web Development"
  discussion: "I've always been fascinated by web technologies and distributed systems, so naturally I took it on as a career. I picked up Rails while working for Fera and love the apps I've built with it. While I’ve spent a substantial amount of my career acting as a full stack developer, I tend towards backend development."
- title: "Concurrency"
  discussion: "I've been in love with concurrency problems since CS350. The nuances of lock-based data structures and communicating between parallel threads is an exciting and unique aspect of computer science. If ever you have a problem with deadlocks or bad performance among threads, send me a message!"
- title: "Keyboards"
  discussion: "I’m a mechanical keyboard enthusiast! I got into the hobby during the pandemic as a way to personalize my home setup. There’s something very enticing about tuning the exact style and tactile feel of my keyboards. I’ve built around 10 keyboards thus far, my latest being a Mode Sonnet with GMK Striker v2 and Silent Box Browns."
- title: "Computers"
  discussion: "I started building computers in highschool so I could play video games with my friends. Since then I've been tweaking my personal setup to perfection. My latest rig is an ITX setup, <a href=‘https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/zzRM8r' target='_blank' rel='noopener' class='project-nested-link' data-toggle='tooltip' title='PC Parts Picker List'>check it out here</a>. I run Windows 11 with WSL for coding."
- title: "Coffee"
  discussion: "This hobby of mine started when coffee became an academic necessity after long nights of studying. Since then I've slowly refined my palate and experimented with as many brewing techniques as possible. My current travel-ready setup is the Knock Aergrind paired with the AeroPress (which I’d highly recommend)."
