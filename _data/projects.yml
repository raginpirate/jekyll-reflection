  link_description: "A process automating robot that inserts CPR course bookings into the Red Cross's database remotely."
  what_is_it: "CPR Bot helps Save-A-Life-CPR by automatically forwarding data from customer bookings to the red cross via form submission."
  how_does_it_work: "CPR Bot uses a webhook attached to Bookeo (the company's booking software) that fires when a course booking is made.  \
  This information is parsed, validated, and submitted to the Red Cross in their requested format. Emails are then generated to log the    \
  work of CPR Bot."
  takeaways: "CPR Bot was my introductory project for web technologies. I learned a ton about HTTP and nice QA tools for Java. Moreover, I \
  got to practice my consulting skills! It was enjoyable engineering a solution from a simple procedure the company was carrying out. If I \
  had the opprotunity to tackle this problem again, I probably would have chosen a much more web-oriented language / framework for this    \
  job, but Java was my language of choice at the time."
  frameworks: "Java, Selenium, Eclipse"

  tags: "Shopify | Rails | Full Stack"
  link_description: "A stand-alone Shopify app that protects small store owners from fraudulent orders and chargebacks."
  what_is_it: "Extra Verification is a one-click to install Shopify app that requests additional verification automatically from shoppers  \
  that create suspiscious looking orders for the first time."
  how_does_it_work: "The app was built using Shopify's template application gem. It utilizes a webhook for Shopify orders that we can      \
  inspect to validate if an order looks suspiscious (based on the User's defined settings). If so, we email both the customer and store      \
  about the verification requirement, and display all of this information in nice Polaris standard forms."
  takeaways: "Rails is sweet and so is Shopify! It was a really awesome experience building a fully-functional application from the ground \
  up. I learned a ton about conventional rails problem solving and decoupling (development of concerns, helpers, decorators, and jobs). I  \
  also really enjoyed how simplistic the Shopify App gem is to start a project with."
