# jekyll-reflection
Personal Jekyll website, soon to be a published jekyll theme.

# Paradigms
#1 Aided by js and browser support BUT NOT COMPRIMISED without such comforts.\
#2 Up to code with ALL PWA STANDARDS.\
#3 Must look exactly as envisioned, no compromises on looks due to difficulty with #1 or #2.\
^AKA, literally anything is possible with #1 and #2 if you put your mind to it.

# todo:
Shift out tons of hardcoded variables to theme.yml, refactor around this (css colors too)
Get service worker to cache everything on the very first page load with no overhead
