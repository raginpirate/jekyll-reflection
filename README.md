# jekyll-reflection
Personal Jekyll website, soon to be a published jekyll theme.

# Paradigms
\#1 Aided by js and browser support BUT NOT COMPRIMISED without such comforts.\
\#2 Up to code with ALL PWA STANDARDS.\
\#3 Must look exactly as envisioned, no compromises on looks due to difficulty with #1 or #2.\
^Literally anything is possible with #1 and #2 if you put your mind to it.

# todo:
JS commenting / improvements\
\
Background image css files need manual modification when someone edits the jekyll theme, need to find a better way\
\
Get service worker to cache everything on the very first page load with no overhead\
\
PWA base theme coloring\
