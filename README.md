# jekyll-reflection
All this repo needs is a good readme, and its a real theme.

# Paradigms
\#1 Aided by js and browser support BUT NOT COMPRIMISED without such comforts.\
\#2 Up to code with ALL PWA STANDARDS.\
\#3 Must look exactly as envisioned, no compromises on looks due to difficulty with #1 or #2.\
^Literally anything is possible with #1 and #2 if you put your mind to it.

# todo:
Background image css files need manual modification when someone edits the jekyll theme, need to find a better way\
\
Get service worker to cache everything on the very first page load with no overhead\
\
Figure out a clean way to minify the serviceworker.js (and perhaps html too since were static serving!) without comprimising the layout of our directory\
\
Move the browserconfig.xml and site.webmanifest out from pages, but while still placing them on root after compilation\
\
Use NPM for vendor assets instead of hard-copying them
